## 📖 Project Progress

When I first received this project, it only contained a **basic "Hello World"** message.  
After that, I added the following improvements:

- 🌈 Gradient background  
- 📝 Styled heading and paragraph  
- 🎉 Interactive button with a click alert  
- 📄 Proper `README.md` documentation
